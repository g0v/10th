main-title: The Explosion of the g0verse!
main-content1: According to the rhythm of the earth, g0v has gone from 0 to 10 and has lived through 10 rotations of the earth around the sun. According to the rhythm of the universe, the 0-time travelers have transformed from netizens to “nobodies”, have gone through 53 hackathons, 4 summits, over 100 small hackathons and events, and infinite instances of online collaboration. These nobodies have popped up all across the multiverse to help monitor elections, participate in protests, help prepare for natural disasters, protect the environment, revitalize minority languages, promote education reform, dispel and report rumors and collaborate during the pandemic. On October 23rd 2022 of the Earth Calendar, g0v is hosting its 10th birthday party. The 0-time travelers from across the metaverse are meeting at the terrestrial location with longitude and latitude of 25.03, 121.54 to celebrate the explosion of the zero-verse and witness the transition from ∅ (zero) to ∞ (infinite)!

what-title: What is g0v
what-content1: "Since 2012, the civic hacker movement has risen up. Calling for transparency and public participation, the g0v community hosted its first hackathon in late 2012, which was called “hackathon 0: mobilize to riot”. Using “write code to change society” as its catchphrase, the civic hacking spark was set off back then and it continues burning bright now."
what-content2: Within eight years, with the contribution of over 1000 participants, through hackathons, the community has set up many platforms aimed at creating more open data or promoting open government; worked to reduce the digital divide; and worked to reduce the barrier to public participation to make public oversight a reality. The community has also promoted the value of rational public dialogue. In this movement for open data and open government, the g0v community has established a new model for civil society collaboration with the government.
