# Internatioinalization

TBD

 * use nginx - serve different html based on user language settings
 * js replace - special tag and syntax to replace/generate text in html
 * pug replace

default en. for static file serving, lookup for <lang>/files.
 * on demand translate

better have a compatible syntax / api with i18n-node, such as: `__("%s cat", 1)`

## frontend

Proposal to markup translatable texts.

### use ldView

    doctype html
    html
      body
        q(pd="i18n") some text ...


### simply use css class

    html
      body
        .i18n some text ...


### use obsolete html tag / custom element

    html
      body
        tt some text ...
        i18n some other text ...

## frontend js implementation:

### Vanilla

Pros: no dependency.
Cons: TBD


    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll '.i18n').map -> it.innerText = __(it.textContent)


### ldView

Pros: re-renderable.
Cons: additional dependency

    ldView do
      root: document.body
      global: true
      text: do
        i18n: -> it.innerText = __(it.textContent)


## pug

simply use interpolation such as 

    span #{__("hello world")}


## server 

only need if we have any message directly generated from server. simply use translation function:

    res.send(__("hello world"))


## nginx

On demand static file building triggered by request and handled, cached by nginx.
based on frontend translation yet handled by server-side-rendering.

    /static/index.html:
    <div class="i18n"> some text </div>

    translate to /zh/index.html only if /zh/index.html is older or not exist:
    <div> 一些字 </div>

all frontend selector for i18n should not be styled since server-sider rendering may remove related selectors.
on demand build is efficient if nginx could check modifiedtime and trigger building, yet it involves both raw html and  translation files so it may not be as simple as we thoughat. a manually rebuild of all static file may be more feasible but it's kinda slow if there are too many files.
