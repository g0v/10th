# Backend

All backend codes go here. Structure:

 - `engine`: core server code. don't touch it, or either:
   - minor changes only if necessary
   - patch to `servebase` and then merge back if possible
 - `base`: demo for making custom router
 - other folders: custom router, automatically loaded by engine.

Put only folders ( not files ) here.
